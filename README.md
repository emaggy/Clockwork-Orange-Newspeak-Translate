(if the latest pull request is merged)
- enter a word to translate (but it won't translate yet)
- autocomplete results from a test object appear (the object's keys are the English words, while the values are the Nadsat words)
- currently they appear as text, but there is a commented out version that makes them appear as separate buttons - that version is likely closer to the final, functioning version, but it is unfinished and has an issue that needs ironing out
- there is an event listener checking for if the enter button is pressed - this links up to the function that takes the input as an argument and returns the translation - however, the translation is not shown yet
- the submit button does not have the same event listener yet
- clicking the autocomplete suggestions does not do anything yet (in either version of the code that shows the suggestions on the screen)

(if the latest pull request is not merged)
- the autocomplete suggestions can be seen in the console instead
